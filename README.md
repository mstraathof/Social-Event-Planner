## The Buzz
The Buzz is a project Team Liger will be developing in CSE216.  
At its current state, it is a web page where you can post a 
message with a title, and upvote or downvote the post.  
It consists of a Web API, backend, and Android support.  
The Web and Android interfaces serves as a way to communicate with the user, and gather the information we will store or update in our database.  
This information is processed through the backend, to ensure consistency and make sure options are not abused.  
There is also an admin interface for maintenance, with functions regular users will not have access to.
